# GrowBox controller PCB

Hardware source of truth: `PCB_V1/PCB_V1.kicad_pro` (KiCad 10). All hardware changes belong in this directory.

**Revision 0.17** — 24 V input on a keyed XT60PW-M (no electronic reverse-polarity protection), LMR16020 12 V auxiliary buck (fans, heater gate driver, AL8853 bias, 3.3 V buck), 24 V/100 W PTC, 24 V pump, two AL8853 constant-current LED channels (panel; two paralleled bars) with common dimming, seven fused load branches. 167 components. ERC 0/0, DRC 0 violations; all components are now placed on the 100 x 100 mm board, with twelve edge connectors and a bottom battery holder. Manufacturing rules and a provisional four-layer stack are set. Routing has not started (350 unconnected links); **not ready for fabrication**. Cost estimation is paused.

## Checks

Run from this directory (needs KiCad 10; `pymupdf` only for sheet images):

```text
python check_all.py           # ERC, netlist + board verification, sizing reports, BOM export, DRC
python check_all.py --write   # also refresh review/*_v17, sheet images and PCB_V1/BOM_schematic.csv
```

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check_all.py` | Runs everything below; fails on any error or any DRC violation |
| `verify_netlist.py` | Critical connectivity, supply domains, fuse branches, LED return isolation, GPIO map |
| `verify_board.py` | Board vs schematic (every pin), power-footprint pad geometry — KiCad Python |
| `verify_placement.py` | Board boundary, edge access, battery side, antenna keepout and manufacturing setup |
| `analyze_led_power.py` | LED boost sizing over 72 cases per channel |
| `analyze_power_path.py` | Input, fuse loading, TVS margins, 12 V buck, switch conduction |
| `export_bom.py` | Full schematic BOM to `PCB_V1/BOM_schematic.csv` |
| `sync_board.py` | Update the unrouted board, retaining component side and orientation from the netlist (refuses routed boards) — KiCad Python |
| `create_staging_board.py` | Create the initial staging board — KiCad Python |
| `audit_bom_cost.py` | Partial price audit against a snapshot (paused since 0.16) |

Typical edit loop: change the schematic → `kicad-cli sch export netlist --format kicadxml -o netlist.xml PCB_V1/PCB_V1.kicad_sch` → `"<KiCad>/bin/python.exe" sync_board.py netlist.xml PCB_V1/PCB_V1.kicad_pcb` → `python check_all.py --write`.
